## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How To Play

* Click on the cards to match pairs.
* Match cards quickly with less moves.
* When two cards are matched, the cards will remain uncovered.
* The game is won when all pairs are matched.
